Discord bot written in JavaScript using discord.js api and mongodb as the database.

An rpg bot, with different commands to battle, upgrade your character and different things to buy from the shop. More features will be added as we go along.

Purpose of this bot was for practice and some parts of the code will not make sense solely because we are amateur programmers.

Any merge/pull request is welcome.
